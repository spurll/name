=====

```
python game.py
```

Bugs and Feature Requests
=========================

Feature Requests
----------------

* Add command line arguments
* Add additional colours and up to four players
* Game ends when one name is completely dominant (or when one name's starting position is completely wiped out)
* "Awards" given at the end to the letter/colour that controls the most space and letter/colour that conquered the most enemy spaces
* Might try to make the colorus of the names slowly scintilate (if it's not CLI)
* Music in the background, with turns happening on the beats?
* Consider some criteria under which the game speeds up or slows down (to make it less monotonous)?
* Consider making this a browser-based Javascript program

Known Bugs
----------

* Kinda sucks when it just ends up as a bunch of `E`s battling each other forever
